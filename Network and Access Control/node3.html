            <h1>Types of Firewalls</h1>
        </nav>

        <p>
            Firewalls play a crucial role in network security by monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic. There are different types of firewalls, each with its own set of features and capabilities to protect against various cyber threats.
        </p>
    
        <h2>1. Stateful Firewalls</h2>
        <p>
            Stateful firewalls, also known as dynamic packet filtering firewalls, operate at the network layer (Layer 3) and keep track of the state of active connections. These firewalls make decisions based on the context of the traffic, considering the state of the connection, source and destination IP addresses, ports, and the protocol being used. Stateful firewalls are more intelligent in filtering traffic compared to stateless firewalls.
        </p>
    
        <h2>2. Stateless Firewalls</h2>
        <p>
            Stateless firewalls, or static packet filtering firewalls, filter traffic based solely on predefined rules such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols. Unlike stateful firewalls, they do not maintain awareness of the state of active connections. Stateless firewalls are simpler and less resource-intensive but may not provide the same level of context-aware filtering as stateful firewalls.
        </p>
    
        <h2>3. Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)</h2>
        <p>
            Next-Generation Firewalls combine traditional firewall features with advanced capabilities such as intrusion prevention, deep packet inspection, and application-layer filtering. NGFWs go beyond port and protocol analysis, allowing organizations to set policies based on specific applications or services. They often include threat intelligence and can identify and block sophisticated threats, providing a more comprehensive approach to network security.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Key Features and Differences</h2>

        <h2>Choosing the Right Firewall</h2>
        <p>
            The choice between stateful, stateless, or next-generation firewalls depends on the specific security requirements of an organization. While stateful firewalls are suitable for basic network protection, organizations dealing with advanced threats and complex network environments may opt for next-generation firewalls to benefit from additional features and capabilities.
