            <h1>Cloud Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)</h1>
        </nav>

        <p>
            Cloud computing offers various service models that define the level of control and responsibility shared between the cloud provider and the user. These models, commonly known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), cater to different needs and use cases within the cloud ecosystem.
        </p>
    
        <h2>1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h2>
        <p>
            IaaS provides users with virtualized computing resources over the internet. Key features include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Virtualized Infrastructure:</strong> Users can access virtualized computing resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networking.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> IaaS allows users to scale resources up or down based on demand, providing flexibility and cost-efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Control:</strong> Users have control over the operating system, applications, and configurations, giving them more flexibility but also more responsibility for management.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h2>
        <p>
            PaaS offers a platform that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without dealing with the complexities of underlying infrastructure. Key features include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Application Development:</strong> Developers can focus on coding and application logic without managing infrastructure concerns like hardware or operating systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Scaling:</strong> PaaS platforms often include automatic scaling to handle varying workloads and demand.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced Management Overhead:</strong> PaaS abstracts away much of the infrastructure management, allowing developers to concentrate on application development.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Heroku, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>3. Software as a Service (SaaS)</h2>
        <p>
            SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for users to install, manage, and maintain the software locally. Key features include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ready-to-Use Applications:</strong> Users can access and use software applications directly through a web browser without the need for installation.</li>
            <li><strong>Managed by Providers:</strong> The entire software stack, including infrastructure and maintenance, is managed by the SaaS provider.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> SaaS applications are accessible from various devices with an internet connection.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Choosing the Right Service Model</h2>
        <p>
            The choice between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS depends on factors such as control, flexibility, and management preferences. Organizations often use a combination of these service models based on their specific requirements.
