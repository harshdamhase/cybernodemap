            <h1>Cloud Deployment Models (Public, Private, Hybrid)</h1>
        </nav>

    <p>
        Cloud deployment models define how cloud services are provisioned and used based on the ownership and access to computing resources. The three main deployment models are Public Cloud, Private Cloud, and Hybrid Cloud, each offering distinct advantages and use cases to cater to diverse business needs.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Public Cloud</h2>
    <p>
        Public Cloud refers to cloud services offered by third-party providers over the internet. Key features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Shared Resources:</strong> Resources such as computing power, storage, and applications are shared among multiple users on a pay-as-you-go basis.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Public cloud providers offer scalability, allowing users to easily scale resources up or down based on demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost-Efficiency:</strong> Users pay only for the resources they consume, eliminating the need for upfront infrastructure investments.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Private Cloud</h2>
    <p>
        Private Cloud involves cloud services that are dedicated to a single organization and may be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider. Key features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Exclusive Access:</strong> Resources are dedicated to a single organization, providing greater control over security and compliance.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Organizations can customize the private cloud environment to meet specific business requirements and compliance standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Private cloud offers enhanced security measures and control over data, making it suitable for sensitive workloads.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> VMware Cloud, Microsoft Azure Private Cloud, OpenStack.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Hybrid Cloud</h2>
    <p>
        Hybrid Cloud is a combination of public and private cloud environments, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. Key features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Organizations can leverage both public and private clouds for different workloads, optimizing performance and cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Data and applications can be moved between public and private environments based on changing requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability and Cost-Efficiency:</strong> Hybrid cloud provides the scalability of public cloud for peak workloads while using the cost-effectiveness of private cloud for regular operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> AWS Outposts, Azure Hybrid Cloud, Google Anthos.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Choosing the Right Deployment Model</h2>
    <p>
        The choice between public, private, or hybrid cloud deployment depends on factors such as security, compliance, scalability, and business requirements. Many organizations adopt a hybrid approach to enjoy the benefits of both public and private cloud environments.
