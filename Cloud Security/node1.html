            <h1>Cloud Fundamentals</h1>
        </nav>

        <p>
            Cloud computing has become a fundamental and transformative technology that powers a wide range of applications and services. It involves the delivery of computing services—such as storage, processing power, and applications—over the internet. Cloud computing provides flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency, making it a cornerstone of modern IT infrastructure.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Key Concepts in Cloud Computing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Service Models:</strong> Cloud computing offers various service models, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). These models define the level of control and responsibility shared between the cloud provider and the user.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Deployment Models:</strong> Cloud deployments can be categorized into Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud, and Multi-Cloud. Each deployment model has its own characteristics, advantages, and use cases.</li>
            <li><strong>3. Virtualization:</strong> Virtualization is a key technology that allows multiple virtual instances to run on a single physical server, optimizing resource utilization and enhancing scalability.</li>
            <li><strong>4. Scalability:</strong> Cloud services can scale vertically (increasing resources within a single server) or horizontally (adding more servers to a network) to accommodate changing workloads and demand.</li>
            <li><strong>5. Resource Pooling:</strong> Cloud providers pool computing resources to serve multiple customers, optimizing efficiency and ensuring that resources are dynamically allocated based on demand.</li>
            <li><strong>6. Pay-as-You-Go Model:</strong> Cloud computing often operates on a pay-as-you-go or pay-per-use pricing model, allowing users to pay for the resources they consume rather than making upfront investments.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Benefits of Cloud Computing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cost-Efficiency: Cloud computing eliminates the need for upfront capital investments, and users only pay for the resources they consume.</li>
            <li>Scalability: Cloud services can scale up or down based on demand, providing flexibility and agility for businesses.</li>
            <li>Accessibility: Cloud services are accessible over the internet from anywhere, enabling remote access and collaboration.</li>
            <li>Reliability: Cloud providers often offer high levels of redundancy and reliability, ensuring continuous service availability.</li>
            <li>Security: Cloud providers implement robust security measures, including encryption, access controls, and compliance certifications, to protect user data.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Popular Cloud Providers</h2>
        <p>
            Several cloud providers offer a range of services. Some of the major players include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>2. Microsoft Azure</strong></li>
            <li><strong>3. Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>4. IBM Cloud</strong></li>
            <li><strong>5. Oracle Cloud</strong></li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            Cloud computing has revolutionized the way organizations and individuals consume and deliver IT services. Understanding cloud fundamentals is essential for making informed decisions about adopting and leveraging cloud technologies.
