        <h1>Common Cyber Attacks</h1>
       </nav>

        <p>
            Cyber attackers employ a variety of techniques to compromise computer systems, networks, and data. Recognizing these common attacks is crucial for implementing effective security measures and safeguarding against potential threats.
        </p>
    
        <h2>1. Phishing Attacks</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Phishing attacks</strong> involve the use of deceptive emails, messages, or websites to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or financial details.
        </p>
    
        <h2>2. Malware Infections</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Malware</strong>, a broad category of malicious software, includes viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware. Malware can infect systems and compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.
        </p>
    
        <h2>3. Ransomware</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Ransomware attacks</strong> encrypt a user's files or entire systems, demanding payment (usually in cryptocurrency) for the release of the data. These attacks can cause significant disruption and financial losses.
        </p>
    
        <h2>4. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>DoS attacks</strong> aim to overwhelm a system, network, or service, making it temporarily or indefinitely unavailable to users. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks involve multiple systems to amplify the impact.
        </p>
    
        <h2>5. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</h2>
        <p>
            In <strong>Man-in-the-Middle attacks</strong>, an unauthorized third party intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties. This can lead to data interception, eavesdropping, or injection of malicious content.
        </p>
    
        <h2>6. SQL Injection</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>SQL injection</strong> involves exploiting vulnerabilities in a web application's database by injecting malicious SQL code. Attackers can manipulate or extract sensitive data from the database.
        </p>
    
        <h2>7. Zero-Day Exploits</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Zero-day exploits</strong> target undisclosed vulnerabilities in software before developers release patches or updates. These attacks can be challenging to defend against, as there is no pre-existing fix.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Protective Measures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular Security Training:</strong> Educating users on recognizing and avoiding common attack vectors.</li>
            <li><strong>Firewalls and Antivirus Software:</strong> Implementing security tools to detect and prevent malicious activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular System Updates:</strong> Keeping software, operating systems, and applications up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Monitoring:</strong> Monitoring network traffic for unusual patterns and potential security incidents.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            Staying vigilant and implementing robust cybersecurity practices are essential in mitigating the risks posed by common cyber attacks.
