            <h1>Security Headers and Content Security Policy (CSP)</h1>
        </nav>

        <p>
            Security headers and Content Security Policy (CSP) are important security measures implemented in web applications to mitigate various types of web vulnerabilities and enhance overall security. These mechanisms help protect against attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection by defining and enforcing security policies.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Security Headers</h2>
        <p>
            Security headers are HTTP response headers that provide instructions to the browser on how to handle certain aspects of web security. Common security headers include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):</strong> Instructs the browser to only connect to the website over HTTPS, reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>2. X-Content-Type-Options:</strong> Prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type than declared, reducing the risk of MIME sniffing vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>3. X-Frame-Options:</strong> Controls whether a browser should be allowed to render a page in a frame or iframe, preventing clickjacking attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>4. X-XSS-Protection:</strong> Enables the browser's built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection mechanism, mitigating the impact of XSS attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>5. Referrer-Policy:</strong> Specifies how much information should be included in the Referer header when navigating from one page to another, helping to control information leakage.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Content Security Policy (CSP)</h2>
        <p>
            Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security standard that helps prevent various types of attacks, including XSS, by defining a set of rules regarding which resources can be loaded and executed. Key aspects of CSP include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Script Source:</strong> Specifies from where JavaScript can be executed, helping prevent script injection.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Style Source:</strong> Defines valid sources for stylesheets, reducing the risk of unauthorized style injections.</li>
            <li><strong>3. Image Source:</strong> Specifies valid sources for images, helping prevent the loading of malicious images.</li>
            <li><strong>4. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):</strong> Allows or restricts loading resources from specific CDNs to control the origin of content.</li>
            <li><strong>5. Report-Only Mode:</strong> Enables reporting mode, where violations are reported to a specified endpoint without enforcing the policy.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>1. Implement Security Headers:</strong> Include appropriate security headers in your HTTP responses to enhance browser security settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2. Configure Content Security Policy (CSP):</strong> Define a strict CSP policy to control which resources can be loaded and executed on your web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>3. Regularly Monitor and Update Policies:</strong> Periodically review and update security headers and CSP policies to adapt to changes in your web application and emerging security threats.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            By incorporating security headers and Content Security Policy, web developers can significantly reduce the risk of common web vulnerabilities and enhance the security posture of their applications.
