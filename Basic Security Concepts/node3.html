        <nav><h1>Network Fundamentals</h1></nav>

    <p>
        Network fundamentals form the basis of modern communication, enabling the exchange of data and resources between devices. Understanding key concepts in networking is essential for building and maintaining efficient and secure communication infrastructures.
    </p>

    <h2>What is a Network?</h2>
    <p>
        A network is a collection of interconnected devices (such as computers, servers, and routers) that can communicate with each other. Networks can be local (LAN), connecting devices within a limited area, or wide (WAN), connecting devices over a larger geographical area.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nodes:</strong> Devices connected to the network, such as computers, printers, and servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Links:</strong> Connections between nodes, which can be wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi).</li>
        <li><strong>Protocols:</strong> Rules and conventions governing how data is transmitted and received, such as TCP/IP.</li>
        <li><strong>IP Addressing:</strong> Unique numerical identifiers assigned to each device on a network.</li>
        <li><strong>Subnetting:</strong> Dividing a network into smaller, more manageable segments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Networks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>LAN (Local Area Network):</strong> Limited to a specific geographic area, like a single building or campus.</li>
        <li><strong>WAN (Wide Area Network):</strong> Spans a larger geographic area, often connecting multiple LANs.</li>
        <li><strong>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):</strong> Covers a larger city or metropolitan area.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet:</strong> A global network connecting millions of devices worldwide.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Networking Devices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Router:</strong> Connects different networks and directs data between them.</li>
        <li><strong>Switch:</strong> Connects devices within the same network, facilitating efficient data exchange.</li>
        <li><strong>Hub:</strong> Simple networking device that connects multiple devices but operates at the physical layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Gateway:</strong> Connects different types of networks, translating data between them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Network Security</h2>
    <p>
        Ensuring the security of networks is crucial. Common security measures include firewalls, encryption, access control, and regular monitoring for suspicious activities.
